# Product, Read, and Search Using C++ and Python Integration

* The challenge is to use C++ and Python to create a user interactive application that allow user to select from a list of menu to display list of products, and allow user to search for an item and get a display of the statistics of a single the item from the product.

* In this project, I'm able to read the list of the products from a text file and do statistical computations using C++ and display the results using python to the user.

* Currently the application uses user interactivities using terminal, and doesn't have application security implementations. This could be improved by integrating better UI frameworks like ReactJs or Angular and the security aspect of the application could be improved by adding authentication and authorization tools like Oauth2.0 and other C++ security libraries.

* The most challenging part of this application is configuring Microsoft Visual Studio to integrate both C++ and python programming languages and setting up the methods for integrating both languages. For this I use documentations and other setup instruction to setup the configurations.

* The most interesting part of this project that taught me alot and will be using for other projects is the importance of integrating multiple languages which allows you to use best features of each language to build applications applications with best performance and scalability.

* I made this application maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using industry standards to write the code and by documenting it and storing it here in github for other developers to play with it.
